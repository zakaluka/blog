<h1 id="introduction-to-advent-of-code-2016">Introduction to Advent of Code 2016</h1>
<p>When developing software as a hobby, it is important to find interesting problems to keep interest high. As I posted earlier, I will be making my future posts based on the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016">Advent of Code</a> challenge for 2016. But, what is Advent of Code?</p>
<p>If you're not familiar, here is a description from their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, having done 5 days, I've found the problems very interesting and, in at least one case, extremely challenging.</p>
<p>This is just meant to be an introductory post. Next post will dive into Day 1.</p>
