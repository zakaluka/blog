# Introduction to Advent of Code 2016

When developing software as a hobby, it is important to find interesting problems to keep interest high. As I posted earlier, I will be making my future posts based on the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016) challenge for 2016. But, what is Advent of Code?

If you're not familiar, here is a description from their website:

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

So far, having done 5 days, I've found the problems very interesting and, in at least one case, extremely challenging.

This is just meant to be an introductory post. Next post will dive into Day 1.
